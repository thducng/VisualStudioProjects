Introuction
- Name
- A bit about the feature drag and drop shell integration
- Demonstration of handed in Student Client
- Demonstration of redesigned Student Client
- Summary with pictures comparisons

Drag and Drop Shell Integration
- Is an image that follows the mouse when the left mouse button is pressed,
  the image then disappeares when the the button is released
- Helps the user identify which image that is bein held onto
- Makes sure that the drag and drop is being used, might had been confusing
  whether the image was been picked up or not.

- Left picture shows an example of holding an notepad file, the start of drag
  and drop, can be used and demonstrated by moving a file from a folder to another
- Right picture shows a photoshopped demonstration of how the shell integration
  might had been if it was succesfully implementet, the gun is being held onto

- Its nessesarity was clear after the usibility test, but the remaining time
  to create the redesign wasnt enough, so the priority was placed on the other
  findings.

Student Client Demonstration
- Before demonstrating the student client, i would like to highlight these five
  things to be changed in the redesign
	- Sizes of Columns and Images
	- The text box to the right that will be removed
	- The buttons placement and names
	- The background colour

- When showing the client
	- Show
		- Demonstrate the drag and drop
		- This textbox will be removed
		- The buttons that will be changed
		- the size of the columns and images
		- There is five total scroll bars, the last three will be removed

Redesigned Student Client
- Before demonstrating the redesign, i would like to mention these additions to
  the student client
	- Whenever the user fails to login, the textbox will mention it, but if
	  the user fails multiple times, the textbox will still mention it, but
	  the text is the same, it wouldnt mention how many times it had tried
	  so the user might be confused whether the system even tried to 
	  authenticate, what has been done, is that the name will be erased when
	  the login fails, so that the user can see, that the system tried but it
	  fails.
	- Another button has been added "How to play", this button will open up
	  another window, that will explain how the interface works and how to
	  operate the scroll bars, it will also explain how to complete the
	  exercise.
	- Another window has been added for the finish button, because if the
	  user tries to finish before the exercise is completed, this window
	  will pop up explaining why the exercise is not yet completed, and if
	  the user wants to quit, the pop up will also advise on how to do that.
	- The image of the professions had to be changed into the name of the 
	  professions instead of an image, this was one of the wished from the
	  stakeholders.
	- Shortly the layout in general has been changes, the fonts the placement
	  of buttons and the sizes of columns.

- When showing client
	- Show
		- Demonstrate drag and drop, one on each row on each column
		- Demonstrate the scroll bar
		- Demonstrate the How to play button
		- Demonstrate the finish button
		- Then close the exercise.

Summary
- 1. slide
	- In the before redesign, the sizes of the columns is widther than the
	  after, to make space for a scroll bar, that will appear when the number
	  of rows exceeds four.
	- Everything on the right of the before, has been removed in the after
- 2. slide
	- When there is more than four rows, the scroll bar will appear, here is
	  the difference, on the after the three last scroll bars has been
	  removed, and is now scrollable by using one scroll bar, the profession
	  column width has been slighty increased to fit a scrollbar, and will
	  reduce itself when the scroll bar disappears.
- 3. slide
	- The two new windows is the result of removing the text box, one for
	  explaining how the exercise works, another for explaining why the user
	  couldnt finish the exercise. The textbox before did what both of these
	  windows does now.

	- And thats all for the student client and its redesign.
